This basic android application allows users to monitor their cardiovascular health.
It allows users to keep track of their systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and 
  heart rate, as well as log the time and date of the reading, and a short comment about the reading.
  
This was my first time building an android application from start to finish on my own, so it is a bit unoptimized, and as such doesn't run all that quickly.
